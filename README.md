# Cortex-SSL

This repository is the official implementation of our conference paper titled [*Self-Supervised Pretraining for Cortical Surface Analysis*](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-66955-2_7) published in Medical Image Understanding and Analysis.

*In Phase I, the GNN autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the original cortical surfaces from their masked versions. In Phase II, the pretrained encoder weights are leveraged for supervised fine-tuning, focusing on target tasks such as segmentation and age prediction.*
